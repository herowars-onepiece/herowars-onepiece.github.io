		<h1>One Piece Guild</h1>
		<h3>A brief guide for members to learn the ins and outs.</h3>
		<br />
		<ul>
		<li><p><b>FIGHT IN THE GUILD WARS AS MUCH AS YOU CAN!</b> Please do. Even if you can't beat anyone, just attacking gets us points.</p></li>
		<li><p>For the Adventures, <b>PLEASE</b> read the <a href="#Adventures">guide below</a> and follow it. It's really important, and most people don't seem to know how to do this properly.</p></li>
		<li><p>Try not to attack your fellow guild members.</p></li>
		<li><p>Try to bring in as much Titanite and Prestige as you can.</p></li>
		<li><p>Configure your war defense teams, and keep them updated.</p></li>
		<li><p>Try to level your titans. Those are very important for the Guild, and it's easy to leave them unleveled.</p></li>
		</ul>
		<br />
		<p><b>Have fun!</b></p>

		<h3 id="Adventures">Adventure Guide</h3>
		<p>Adventures are tricky. Three guild members go through a map and try to make enough points fighting to unlock four chests, with a boss at the end.</p>
		<p>The point is <b>not</b> to just beat the boss. The point is getting all three chests. If you do, you can Raid the Adventure with more adventure points for the duration of that day without repeating the adventure.</p>
		<p>So the main rules are:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Towers connect red lines to fights and buff those enemies. You need to <b>defeat the tower before going for the buffed fight</b>. This is especially important for the boss. Bosses are very hard to kill without removing the surrounding towers first. So don't try it.</li>
			<li>Each player has a limited number of points he can use to fight on the Adventure. <b>Don't waste them.</b></li>
			<li>
				In order to get all three chests plus the boss chest, players need to win at least a number of fights depending on the adventure. This is hard to guess, but fortunately there are guides to help us. You can find those:
				<ul>
					<li>On this website: <a href="https://www.solfors.com/" target="_blank">SolFors</a></li>
					<li>And this website <a href="https://hero-wars.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Guides" target="_blank">Fandom</a>
					<li>You can also find <a href="#AdventureExamples">examples below for three popular adventures</a></li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>When someone starts an adventure, he needs to go to one of this sites, copy the three lines for each participant and paste them on the Adventure Chat</li>
			<li>Then, when others join that adventure, they need to choose a line and follow it strictly.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>That's it. If you follow those steps, you're guaranteed to unlock all four chests every time and avoid other players getting frustrated with you</p>
		<p>Follow it <b>STRICTLY</b>. Don't change directions, don't go for the boss if you're not supposed to. <b>Follow the lines</b>.
		<p>If you still have any doubts or questions, dont hesitate to post them on the Guild Chat or asking Manjamanga, or other senior member for help.</p>
