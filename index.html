		<h1>One Piece Guild</h1>
		<h3>A brief guide for members to learn the ins and outs.</h3>
		<br />
		<ul>
		<li><p><b>FIGHT IN THE GUILD WARS AS MUCH AS YOU CAN!</b> Please do. Even if you can't beat anyone, just attacking gets us points.</p></li>
		<li><p>For the Adventures, go to Adventure Maps on <a href="https://www.solfors.com/" target="_blank">this website</a> and follow one of the lines. <b>Please don't just do adventures at random, nobody benefits from that!</b></p></li>
		
		<li><p>Try not to attack your fellow guild members.</p></li>
		<li><p>Try to bring in as much Titanite and Prestige as you can.</p></li>
		<li><p>Try to level your titans. Those are very important for the Guild, and it's easy to leave them unleveled.</p></li>
		</ul>
		<br />
		<p><b>Have fun!</b></p>
